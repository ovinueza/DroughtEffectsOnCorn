## Motivation 
Corn is a multipurpose crop. We use its derivatives every day in products like pharmaceutical, textiles, sweeteners and is blended in fuel for our vehicles, making it an indispensable asset for the U.S. economy. Therefore, it is important to know how extreme weather evetns like drought, affect the production, yield and price of corn.
